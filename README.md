# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```sh
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

The production build will be in the `dist` directory, optimized with:
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Tree shaking for smaller bundle size
- Optimized asset handling

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod`
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Use GitHub Actions or deploy manually
- **Any static host**: Upload the `dist` folder contents

## Data Storage

Currently, the app uses **localStorage** for data persistence. All transactions and parties are stored in the browser. To migrate to a backend API:

1. Update the API functions in `src/lib/api.ts`
2. Replace localStorage calls with HTTP requests
3. Configure API URL in environment variables

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_APP_NAME=KyatFlow
```
